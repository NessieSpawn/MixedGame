	// welp here's a funny tweak
	// splitter rifle changes titan's shared energy regen delay to 0.5 on activation
	// which means respawn's intended energy regen delay SHOULD be 0.5 instead of 0.2
	// with this change, it will be safe to remove hardcoded regen delay in mp_titanweapon_particle_accelerator.nut
	// can't explain how much I love respawn's coding
	// for npcs, leaving a question here: does their energy regen affected by scripts? or are they always take values from their AISet files?
	//sharedEnergyRegenDelay 	0.2
	
	// tweaked value
	sharedEnergyRegenDelay 		0.5
	sharedEnergyRegenRate 		100.0
